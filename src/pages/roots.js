                  While we realize that we cannot confine God to mere articles
                  of faith, we also recognize the importance of doctrine in
                  these days when people are being led astray by false
                  teachings. To avoid being tossed about by the winds of
                  doctrine, it is important for every believer to have a firm
                  foundation in the basic fundamental doctrines of the
                  Scriptures.

                  The new life fellowship (NLF) began in a small way in 1983,
                  when the lord Jesus Christ impressed upon pastor V.M. Samuel
                  and his wife, Somey, to move out of Mumbai and pioneer a
                  church in Mangalore in Karnataka. God enabled them to envision
                  a church planting movement throughout Karnataka, which still
                  remains one of the most unreached states in south India.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1987, Pastor V.M. Samuel and Somey handed over the churches
                  in Mangalore to Pastor Donald and Winnie Menezes and shifted
                  base to Bangalore to lead the church planting movement of the
                  New Life Fellowship. They continue to serve their Master as
                  the Senior Pastors of the New Life Fellowship Churches,
                  overseeing more than 120 churches in South India & the Middle
                  East.
